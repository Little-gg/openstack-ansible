OpenStack Ansible
#################

OpenStack-Ansible is an `official OpenStack project`_ which aims to deploy
production environments from source in a way that makes it scalable while
also being simple to operate, upgrade, and grow.

For an overview of the mission, repositories and related Wiki home page,
please see the formal `Home Page`_ for the project.

For those looking to test OpenStack-Ansible using an All-In-One (AIO) build,
please see the `Quick Start`_ guide.

For more detailed Installation and Operator documentation, please see the
`Install Guide`_.

If OpenStack-Ansible is missing something you'd like to see included, then
we encourage you to see the `Developer Documentation` for more details on
how you can get involved.

If you have some questions, or would like some assistance with achieving your
goals, then please feel free to reach out to us on the
`OpenStack Mailing Lists`_ (particularly openstack-operators or openstack-dev)
or on IRC in ``#openstack-ansible`` on the `freenode network`_.
